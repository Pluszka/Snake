# Snake
Just old, good Snake.
It's day 20th project from Angela Yu's bootcamp. 

NOTE

The snake's head detects left and right side of screen a little bit too early when snake is bigger an I have no idea why it's happening.

I'm sorry for that, maybe I'll fix that in the future.

CHANGELOG 30.01.2022
1) Now snake can go a little bit too far from egde, but I think it's better than it was.
2) Better locations for food (food doesn't appears in corners)
3) Tracking high score
